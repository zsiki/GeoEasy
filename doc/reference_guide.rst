GeoEasy 3.2
===========
Reference Guide
===============

.. contents:: Table of Contents

GeoEasy is a complex tool for land surveyors 

* to calculate coordinates from observations,
* to convert surveyors' data set into different formats,
* to generate TINs and DEMs and to calculate volumes,
* to adjust 1D/2D/3D networks,
* to calculate parameters of regression shapes over points

The program supports several input and
output formats, so it can easily be inserted into user's work-flow.

Starting the program
--------------------

The Windows setup places az icon on the desktop and adds an item to the programs menu. On Linux the program should be started from the command line.
GeoEasy accepts command line parameters. Among others the language of the user interface
can be selected and input data set can be given in the command line.

.. note:: for Windows users

	You can start GeoEasy from the command line on Windows, too. 
	Open a cmd window, change 
	directory to the GeoEasy installation folder (c:\GeoEasy is the default),
	finally enter *GeoEasy* to start the program.

Using the --help parameter you can see the available command line
options, all are optional

.. code:: bash

	./geo_easy.tcl --help
	GeoEasy 3.2.1

	Usage: geoeasy [options] [files]
 	options:
  	--help [string] - print help info and exit {authors, modules, version}
  	--lang [string] - switch to a different language {cze, eng, es, ger, hun, pl, rus}, default=auto
  	--log [string] - select log {path/to/file.log | stdout | stderr}, default=/home_folder/geo_easy.log
  	--exp extension - export files from command line with the given extension
  	--nogui - process command line parameters and exit
 	files:
  		optional list of files of four types
    		geo_easy data files (.geo, .gsi, etc.) to load
    		geo_easy project file (.gpr) to load
    		tcl script files (.tcl) to execute/load
    		mask definition files (.msk) to load
 	the order of the files in the command line is the order of processing

GeoEasy by default uses the language of the operating system if it is
available (GeoEasy has been localized to that language).
Seven languages are supported when writing this documentation:
Czeh, English, German,  Hungarian, Polish, Russian and Spanish.

You can switch to a different language from the default by the *--lang* 
command line switch. The ISO 639-1 two or ISO 639-2/B three letters codes 
are accepted. For example to start with Hungarian language:

.. code:: bash

	geoeasy --lang hun

Log messages and calculation results are written to a log file beside the
calculation results window. The default location of the log file is the
user's home directory and the name is *geo_easy.log*. Using the *--log*
command line parameter the name and the location of the log file can be
given in the command line. The actual user must have write access to the given 
log file. For example:

.. code:: bash

	geoeasy --log /tmp/mylog.log

.. note:: For Linux users

	If no log file needed for you, you can specify *--log /dev/null* to 
	supress logging. There are two more special log file specifications,
	the *stdout* and the *stderr*. Giving one of these as log file, the
	log messages are sent to the terminal window.

After the optional language and log switches you can give a serie of
GeoEasy data sets and/or Tcl scripts. For example:

.. code:: bash

	geoeasy --lang hun ~/demodata/test1.geo ./startup.tcl

Using the --exp and --nogui options you can use GeoEasy as a batch data
converter. You can specify several input files.

.. code:: bask

	geoeasy --nogui --exp csv demodata/test1.geo demodata/test_trafo.geo

You will get the test1.csv and demodata/test_trafo.csv files in the folder of the input files.

GeoEasy main window
-------------------

Starting the program (without the nogui parameter) the main window appears at the upper left corner of the 
display. This window has only menus and decorations. If the globe is not
rotating the program is busy, the user have to wait.

File menu
~~~~~~~~~

In the file menu besides the file and project handling functions the
communicaton program (ComEasy) and settings can be found.

New
...

A new geo data set is created, in the **Save As** dialog of the operating system
the user can set the location and the name of the new file.
The type of the new file will be the nativ GeoEasy *geo* format. 
The geo/coo/par files will be created on the disk when you save data set.

.. figure:: rg_images/new.png
	:align: center

	File name and folder selection for new data set

Load
....

Open one or more data sets. There are several data types you can select from
(e.g. .geo, .csv, .gsi, etc). You can select more files to load, use Shift or
Ctrl key to select more files. Only the 
memory of the computer limits the number of loaded data sets.

.. figure:: rg_images/load.png
	:align: center

	Input data set selection

If the observations were made in face left and face right, from the readings on
the horizontal and vertical circles and the distances an average is calculated.
GeoEasy stores and uses these average values only.
Averages are calculated if the collimation and index errors are below the 
**maxColl** and **maxIndex** values set in the geo_easy.msk file.

.. note::
	The name of the loaded data sets should be unique. You will see the
	same data set name twice in the cascading menus.

Loading flexible format files
.............................

There are two file types which internal structure is flexible. These are the 
.dmp (for observations) and .csv (for coordinates) types. 
In case of these input files the data structure can be user 
defined, the user can set order and contents of the columns in the file while loading.
When you select .dmp or .csv file another dialog is opened.

.. figure:: rg_images/csv_load.png
	:align: center 

	Text file input dialog

In the upper part of the dialog you can set the meaning and order of columns.
In case of csv the available columns are: *Point number, Easting, Northing,
Elevation, Point code, Point order, Easting prelim., Northin prelim.,
Height prelim* and the special *Skip*. In the dmp (dump) file the following 
columns are allowed: *Station number*, *Point number*, *Horizontal angle*, 
*Vertical angle*, *Slope distance*, *Signal height*, *Instrument height*, 
*Horizontal distance*, *Point code*, *Height diff*, *Height diff leveling* and the 
special *Skip*. Angles can be in GONs (ggg.cccc format) or DMS (ddd-mm-ss format).
A sample dmp file (station number can be empty if it is not changed).

.. code:: text
	Station;Target;Hz;V;SD
	12;23;23-45-12;87-51-10;234.201
	;32;123-23-35;91-03-21
	;54;200-12-34;85-40-12;85.342
	48;57;32-01-06;90-10-31;121.308
	48;59;79-23-56;88-44-22;242.159

When you open the dialog the default
columns are in the list. Press **Add** button to add new column and select
from the opened list. The new column will be added to the end of the list. 
If you would like to change the order of columns, click on a column and the 
**Up**, **Down** and **Delete** buttons became active. The special *Skip* column can
be used to skip a column in the input file.

Multiple separators can be defined, defaults are tab and semicolon.
The *Skip repeated separators* option can be useful for example if you have
space tabbed file (different number of spaces among the columns).

The *Number of header lines* allows to skip the first few lines in the input
(e.g. header lines).

A *Filter expression* can be defiend to filter rows. A regular expression can
also be used. It works as the Linux *grep* command.

At the bottom part of the dialog the first five rows of the input file are shown.

The **Save** and **Load** buttons can be used to save or load setting to/from
a txt/csv file definition (\*.txp). Be careful, the saved file definitions for 
.dmp and .csv files are not compatible (available column sets are different).

Close
.....

Close a loaded data set. Beside this menu option a cascading list of the
loaded data sets pops up. The user can select a data set name from the list.
If the data set to be closed have been changed, the user has an option to save 
it after a question.

Save
....

Save a changed data set. Beside this menu option a cascading list of the
loaded data sets pops up. The user can select a data set name from the list.
The data set is saved to GeoEasy *geo* format even if the type of opened data
set is different. The name and the folder of the
files is the same as the loaded data set.

Save all
........

Save all changed data sets to GeoEasy format.

Save as
.......

Save the selected data set into a different folder/name or type.
Beside this menu option a cascading list of the
loaded data sets pops up.
After selecting a file, in the Save As dialog box you can choose location, name
and type for the output file. After saving the original data set left opened.

Merge
.....

Merge all loaded data sets into a single GeoEasy data set.
After merging the original data sets left opened and the merged data set is not
loaded. If the same point has coordinates in more than one data sets the first
coordinates found are saved to the merged data set.

GNU Gama export
...............

Export observations and coordinates into a GNU Gama XML file. 
First the network dimension (type of file 1D/2D/3D) and output file name is 
selected. Then you can 
select fixed and adjusted points. Only the observation belonging to the 
selected points are written to the output file.
If no fixed points are selected a free network adjustment is solved.

.. note::

	GNU Gama export is only necessary if you would like manually fine tune
	the parameters in the xml file before adjustment.

Close the application. If unsaved data exists you have a chance to save it.

Edit menu
~~~~~~~~~

The menu options in the edit menu can be used to display and edit GeoEasy
data set. A GeoEasy data set consists of three parts:

* observations (field-book)
* coordinates
* observation parameters

Observations
............

This menu option has a cascading menu with the name of the loaded GeoEasy data 
sets. After selecting a data set it is opened in the default mask. A mask is a
windows with tabular data, the *mask* name comes from the old Leica total 
stations.

.. figure:: rg_images/fb.png
	:align: center

	Observations

The field-book contains two type of rows, station and observation records.
In the station records the station number is editable but the target point 
number not. The column headers may contain more labels, for example *target
height* and *instrument height*. The colour of the value defines the type of 
data.

The observations window contains a menu bar and pop up menus.

Coordinates
...........

This menu option has a cascading menu with the name of the loaded GeoEasy data 
sets. After selecting a data set it is opened in the default mask. A mask is a
windows with tabular data, the *mask* name comes from the old Leica total 
stations.

.. figure:: rg_images/fb.png
	:align: center

	Coordinate list

The coordinate window contains a menu bar and pop up menus.

Observation parameters
......................

The observation parameters are metadata about the observations and 
coordinates, id/name of observer, date, instrument type and standard
deviations. All fields are optional. If no standard deviations are given, the
values defined in the  **Calculation parameters** are used.

.. figure:: rg_images/obsparam.png
	:align: center

	Observation parameters

Load mask definitions
.....................

Starting GeoEasy the mask definitions are loaded from the geo_easy.msk file.
Using this menu option additional mask definitions can be loaded from user created
file. You can create your own mask definitions in a file. It can be loaded by 
this menu option. You can also extend the mask definitions in the geo_easy.msk file
but if you upgrade GeoEasy to a new version you will lost your own mask definitions

Calculate menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The calculation menu contains those calculation which works with several 
point and the results cause change more lines in fieldbooks, coordinate lists,
like for example traversing.

Orientations
............

This menu option calculates orientations for all unoriented known stations.
The results are listed in the **Calculation results** window and the orientation
angles are stored in the field-books. You can view orientation angles if you change the mask to *orientation*.

	Average orientation angle                        58-10-16

Preliminary orientations
........................

This menu option calculates orientations for all unoriented stations which 
have preliminary or final coordinates.
The results are listed in the **Calculation results** window and the orientation
angles are stored in the field-books.
This is useful before 2D or 3D network adjustment, to get preliminary
orientations.

Delete orientations
...................

This menu option removes all orientation angles from the loaded data sets.
It is useful if all orientations should be recalculated. First delete
orientations, than calculate orientations.

Traversing
..........

Different type of traversing lines can be solved. Before starting the 
traversing calculation the orientations have to be made at the start and
end point if possible.
The points in the travesing line are selected from the list of possible points.
The type of traversing line (closed line, loop, free, ...) is detected by
the program.

The calculation results are sent to **Calculation results** window.

.. note::

	Travesing points can be selected by the mouse in the graphic window, too.
	See traversing tool.

Traversing node
...............

A travesing node is an unknown point at which three or more free
travessing lines meet. First the coordinates of the node are calculated from
free travese lines as a weighted average. Finally the traversing lines
are solved as closed loop traversing.

Trigonomerical line
...................

This menu option calculates the elevations in a traverse line using
triginometric height calculation. Zenith angles have to be measured
between tranversing points. The points in the trigonometric line are
selected from the list of possible points.

The calculation results are sent to **Calculation results** window.

Trigonometrical node
....................

Similiar to the traversing node, three or more free trigonometric lines
having the same endpoint are calculated.


Intersection of two lines
.........................

Two lines are given by two-two points and the intersection of the two lines
is calculated. The id/name of the intersection point can also be given if
so the intersection point is stored in the opened data sets.
The result of the calculation can be seen in the Calculation results window.
This calculation is made in 2D.

Point on line
.............

A new point is calculated along a line given by an offset from the first point.
Beside the offset (Horizontal distance) optionally the measured distance 
(total length) can be given. The total length is used to calculate a scale 
between the calculated and the measured lengths.
The result of the calculation can be seen in the Calculation results window.
This calculation is made in 2D.

Length
......

The lengths between a serie of points can be calculated. 
Both the total length and the individual distances are shown in the
*Calculation results* window. There is a tool in the graphic window,
where you can mark points by the mouse.

Arc setting out
...............

The coordinates of arc points can be calculated here. Pure arc and 
arc with transition curves are both allowed. Three points have to be
specified, first the intersection of tangents, an arbitrary point on the
incoming and outgoing tangent. Finally the other parameters of the arc
have to be given in a dialog box.

.. figure:: rg_images/arc.png
	:align: center

	Arc parameters

Leave the *Transition parameter* empty if pure arc is planed.
Optionally detail points can be calculated giving a distance or a number of 
points. If both fields are empty only the main points of arc are calculated.

Preliminary coordinates
.......................

Preliminary coordinates are used to display points in the graphics window, 
before calculating final coordinates. Other usage of preliminary coordinates
belongs to network adjustment. Preliminary coordinates have different colour
(red is the default) in the coordinate list and in the graphic window.

Preliminay coordinates and orientations are calculated in an iteration. You 
may get a message about points which horizontal coordinates or elevations
cannot be calculated for.

Recalculate preliminary coordinates
...................................

All preliminary coordinates are deleted and the preliminary coordinate
calculation is invoked. It is useful if faullty preliminary coordinates 
were calculated caused by errors in the data sets. After corecting 
errors use this option to recalculate preliminary coordinates.

3D network adjustment, Horizontal network adjustment, Levelling network adjustment
..................................................................................

.. note::

	Before adjustment you have the set/check the mean errors of observations and
	adjustment parameters.

During 3D network adjustment both horizontal coordinates an elevations are
calculated using the least squares method. During horizontan network
adjustment the horizontal coordinates are calculated. During levelling network
adjustment the elevations are calculated
All loaded data sets are considered during the adjustment calculation.
The three network adjusments are very similiar from the point of the user 
interface.

First you have to select unknown points from a list, the coordinates of these 
points are changed during the calculations. The list contains all points 
having preliminary or final coordinates considering the dimension of the
adjusted network (e.g. incase of 3D adjustment points having 3D coordinates
are listed only). At least one point have to be selected.

.. figure:: rg_images/adj1_3d.png
	:align: center

	Unknown points selection

In the second list the fixed points can be selected. Here the points having 
final coordinates are only listed.  If none of the points are selected a 
free network adjusment is calculated.

.. figure:: rg_images/adj2_3d.png
	:align: center

	Fixed points selection

Observations between the points selected in the two lists are considered in the
adjustment calculation.

GeoEasy will prepare an xml file for GNU Gama with the coordinates of the 
selected points and observations among the selected unknown and fixes points.
The calculation is made by GNU Gama and the results of the calculation is
shown in the calculation results window. Please use GNU Gama documentation
for the details of the result list. You can set a short output list in
the **Adjustment parameters** dialog.
The coordinates of the unknown points are updated in the coordinate lists 
after adjusment.

Coordinate transformation
.........................

The horizontal coordinates of loaded data sets are transformed to the selected 
target data set. The transformation parameters are calculated from the 
common points. Do not open the target data set before the calculation.

Selecting the coordinate transformation from the menu, you are asked for the
target data set. It must be in GeoEasy .geo format. The program pops up a list
of the common points among the loaded data sets and the target one, 
select as many points as you would like, but please
consider that, the available transformation types depends on the number of
points selected. The available transformation are:

#. 4 parameters orthogonal transformation (minimum 2 common points)
#. 3 parameters orthogonal transformation (minimum 2 common points, no scale change)
#. Affine transformation (minimum 3 common points)

.. note::

    There are other transformations in GeoEasy. From the Coordinate list
    you can make 2D transformation from stored parameters or manualy
    given parameters. 

Elevation transformation
........................

Vertical offset is calculated between the loaded data sets and a target data
set. It is very similar to the coordinate transformation, but a single vertical
offset is calculated between the two vertical system. The offset parameter
can be saved to a *vhs* text file (see appendix for file format).

New detail points
.................

Calculate horizontal coordinates and elevations for all detail ponts which
have no final coordinates yet. Missing orientations are calculated on
stations.

All detail point
................

Recalculates the coordinates, elevations of all detail points even 
already calculated.

3D intersections
................

This calculation calculates 3D positions from directions and
zenith angles measured from the end points of one or more base lines.
Horizontal coordinates are calculated from intesections, elevations are 
calculated from triginometric heightings.

Windows menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the **Windows** menu new windows can be opened and the user can switch 
among opened windows.

New graphic window
..................

Open a new graphic window. The number of open graphic windows is limited to ten.
Each graphic window has menu and toolbar. You can set different zoom level and
display options in graphic windows.

Log window
..........

Only one log window can be opened. It shows the resuts of calculations also.
The content of the log vindow is mirrored in the log file (even if the log 
window is closed).

Console window

~~~~~~~~~

The Help menu contains two options, Help and About. Both of them display a
small dialog box. The Help box contains only a link to documentation folder 
on the Github page of the program. The About box shows version,
modules and copyright info. The date in the About box is important for 
development (nightly build) versions. The version number is not changed for
development versions but the date.

GeoEasy field-book window
-------------------------

You can open a field-book window from the main window **Edit/Observations** menu.
In the field-book window you can view and edit field-books. Each loaded 
field-book is opened in a separate window.
The actually displayed values from the field-book depend on the actual 
mask (format). There are some predefined masks and the user can add 
new masks. The field-book window has its own menu and popup menu.

.. figure:: rg_images/observations.png
	:align: center

	Field-book in default mask

Commands menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mask
....

Select layout of field-book from loaded formats. There are nine different 
field-book formats in the default configuration file (*geo_easy.msk*):

- *horiz* (Station number, Point number, Horizontal angle, Vertical angle, Distance)
- *levelling* (Station number, Point number, Heigh diff, Distance)
- *orientation* (Station number, Point number, Horizontal angle, Orientation angle)
- *tahimeter* (Station number, Point number, Signal height, Horizontal angle, Vertical angle, Distance)
- *tahimeter_code* (Station number, Point number, Point code, Signal height, Horizontal angle, Vertical angle, Distance)
- *tahimeter_dm* (Station number, Point number, Signal height, Horizontal angle, Height diff, Distance)

The default mask is *tahimeter*. The user can customise existing masks and can
add new masks editing *geo_easy.msk* file or can create new files for mask 
definitions. The masks in *geo_easy.msk* file are loaded when GeoEasy starts.
Mask definitions in external files can be loaded manualy using 
*Edit/Load mask definitions* from the menu of the main window.

Number of rows
..............

You can set the number of rows displayed in this window. The default is 20.

Refresh all window
..................

Refresh the content of all opened window.

Refresh
.......

Refresh the content of actual window.

New station
...........

This adds a new station record to the end of the field-book. Enter the station ID in 
the small dialog box.

Coordinate list
...............

This opens a new coordinate list window belonging to this field-book.

Check field-book
................

Search for errors in the field book. The list of the found errors is written to
the *Calculation results* window. There are three different things checked

	* obligatory value missing (e.g. point ID)
	* values should be together (e.g. slope distance and zenith angle)
	* values shouldn't be together (e.g. station ID and target ID)

Save
....

Save the field-book and the releated coordinate list to the disk in nativ 
GeoEasy format.

Save as CSV
...........

Save field-book data into a given file in coma separated values format. 
The fields displayed in the actual mask are exportted only.

Save as RTF
...........

Save field-book data into a given file in rich text format.
The fields displayed in the actual mask are exportted only.

**Hép** option shows a links to GitHub doc pages. **About** shows version number, date and 
active modules.

Popup menu
~~~~~~~~~~

The popup menu is displayed when you click in the field-book with
right mouse button.

The first or first few options in the popup menu above the horizontal line show
the possible value types in the field (it comes from the mask definition). 
For example you can change slope distance to horizontal distance and vica versa.
There is a special "*Not used*" type for *Horizontal angle*, *Vertical angle*", and 
"*Slope distance*". Setting this type for an observed value, it won't be used in
any calculation. It can be useful for blunders without deleting the observation.


Delete
......

Delete the actual row if it is a observation record or delete all
observations from this station if it is a station record. You have to
confirm the deletion.

New observation
...............

Add a new observation record after the actual row. First the point number 
have to be entered and a new ro is added what you can fill later.

GeoEasy coordinate list
-----------------------

Each loaded data set contains a coordinate list. A list is opened from the
Edit menu of the main window. Points in the coordinate list are ordered by
*Point number* using *dictionary* sort (case insensitive but  numbers sorted as integers).
Points may have preliminary or fix (final) coordinates in the
coordinate list. Preliminary coordinates are used only for graphical display
of points and for network adjusments.

Commands menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mask
....

The user can here select from the different display formats of the coordinate 
list. There are four standard masks:

- difference - displays fix coordinates and coordinate differences to an other coordinate list, use it with *Coordinate differences* option from this menu
- fix - displays fix (final ) coordinates
- fix_stdev - displays fix coordinates and standard deviation, standard deviations are loaded from network adjusments
- prelim_fix - displays fix or preliminary coordinates, preliminary coordinates are displayed only if no fix coordinates are available

Users can add extra mask.

	* values shouldn't be together (e.g. preliminary and final coordinates)

Transformation
..............

Transform the the coordinates of the actual coordinate list in 2D and/or 1D.
2D orthogonal transformation parameters (offset, rotation and scale) and
1D vertical offset can be given.
The coordinates in the coordinate list are overwritten by the transformed
values.

Transformation, parameters from file
....................................

Stored transformation parameter set can be applied to the coordinates in the
list. Two different data format can be used for stored parameters, .prm
(Helmert and affine transformation) and .all (polinomial), see the data formats
the appendix.
The coordinates in the coordinate list are overwritten by the transformed
values.

Coordinate differences
......................

The coordinate difference of two coordinate lists are calculated. The second
coordinate list you compare to should not be loaded. Select the GeoEasy data
set to compare to from the standard file selection dialog and change the mask
to the *difference* to see the result.

Swap East-North, Swap East-Elev, Swap North-Elev

	DTM creation

If the *From points in coordinate lists* is selected, the border and break lines
must be draw before by the *Break line* tool. If no break lines given the
*Convex boundary* option have to be checked, otherwise empty TIN created.
Hole markers can be added by the *Hole marker* tool to supress triangle
generation in a closed area.

TIN can be created from a DXF file where 3D points and 2d/3D lines/polylines are
given. 2D lines/polylines are accepted if there are 3D point at each vertices/endpoints
of the 2D line/polyline.
Select one of the *Layer list* buttons first to select the input file
and select one or more layers for mass point, break lines and hole markers.

A text file may also be used where the points, break/boundary lines, and hole markers are 
given. See the appendix for the poly file format.

	Non-konvex border and hole marker

Load
....

Open an existing DTM. The input is selected from the standard file selection 
dialog. Beside the .dtm file a .pnt and a. pol file have to be in the 
same folder.

Add
...

Add another DTM to the loaded one and regenerate triangles considering points,
break/border lines from both DTMs.

Close
.....

Close the loaded DTM.

Save
....

Save the loaded DTM.

Profile
.......

Create a profile specifying start and end points and distance between point
in the profile. The interpolated elevations with horizontal coordinates are
printed in the Calculation results window. Optionally a DXF or a GeoEasy 
coordinate file can be created from the interpolated profile points.

	Profile dialog

.. note::

	You can use the *Height interpolation* tool from the toolbar to specify start and end points with the mouse. Click on the start point and drag the mouse to draw a rubber line and release mouse button et the end point.

Contours
........

Generate contour lines. The contour interval can be set in a dialog box.
Enter 0 for the contour interval to erase contour lines from the 
graphic window.

.. note::

	You can export contour lines to a DXF file using the DXF ourput.

Volume
......

Calculate volume above a reference plain.
The user have to enter the height of the reference plain. The volume is
calculated in the prisms above the reference plain. The result is written into 
the *Calculation results* window.

.. code::

    2020.11.02 19:52 - Volume ... - test
    Base height  Volume        Above        Below       Area     Surface area

The *Volume* = *Above* - *Below*.

Volume difference
.................

Calculate volume difference between the loaded and another TIN. GRIDs are
generated from both TINs using the same GRID steps. Only the common area of the
two generated GRIDs are considered.

.. figure:: rg_images/ascii_grid.png

First the user have to give the grid step (step for north and east axis). 
Next in the file selection dialogue a previously saved DTM can be selected.

.. code::

    2020.11.02 19:40 - Volume difference ... testa - testb
    Grid step: 50.00
    Lower left  corner: 655886.80 222996.11
    Upper right corner: 656417.18 223621.18
    Cut  Volume: 32125.1 m3 Area: 125000.0 m2
    Fill Volume: 10376.4 m3 Area:  45000.0 m2
    Same: 10000.0 m2

Beside the results in the *Calculation results* window a new difference grid is
generated in the folder of the loaded TIN. This file is an ESRI ASCII GRID
which can be loaded into several sortware among others into QGIS.

VRML/X3D export
...............

Export the actual DTM to standard 3D data format for free viewers e.g. view3dscene.

KML export
..........

Export the actual DTM to standard 3D data format for free GIS programs e.g. QGIS.

ASCII grid export
.................

Interpolate heights at regular grid to use data in GID programs e.g. GRASS GIS, QGIS.

LandXML export
..............

It exports the DTM ro LandXML format to use in other software.

Statistics
..........

it shows some information of the loaded DTM, the bane of the loaded file,
the number of points, triangles, break/border lines and holes and the
extent of the TIN. The information is displayed in a popup window and 
it is written to the *Calculation results* window.

Help menu
~~~~~~~~~

Help menu contains a single option *Help* which shows the links to the documenttion on the GitHub page
of the project.

Popup menu
~~~~~~~~~~

If you right click on a point in the graphic window a menu pops up.
The first option is the point id, selecting it information is displayed 
in a window.
The othe menu options are identical to the calculation submenu of
the observations or coordinate list window.


GeoEasy calculation results
---------------------------

All calculation results are sent to this window. Users can copy
selected part of the content from this window to the clipboarand paste that
to other application (e.g. into doc files).

.. note::

	On Windows operating system use the Ctrl/C to copy selected part to
	the clipboard. On Linux use middle mouse button click to paste
	selected part into another application.

All strings written to the Calculation results window are also sent to the log
file. So if this windows is closed the calculation results are preserved in
the log and user can review them later.

File menu
~~~~~~~~~

GeoEasy console window
----------------------

The console window is useful to execute Tcl commands or load and execute 
tcl scripts. The console window is divided into three parts, the menu bar
at the top,
the input field below the menu bar and the history (list of previous commands)
in the main body.

Enter any tcl command into the input field and press Enter key. The result of 
the command is sent to the Caculation Results window and the command to the 
history list.

File menu
~~~~~~~~~

The first option of the menu (**Find**) useful to find text in the console 
window.

The **Load tcl file** allows to load and excute external tcl scripts. 

Use the **Save as...** option from the menu to save the tcl commands
from the history list into a file or **Save selection...** to save the 
selected commands only.

==========

GeoEasy data format
-------------------

GeoEasy uses three files for each field-book, in the same folder. The name of 
these three files have to be the same.

	.geo
		the observations

	.coo
		the coordinates

	.par
		meta-data (optional)

Each line of the files consists of a list of code-value pairs. The order of the
code-valu pairs is not significant.

Beside the above mentioned data file there is a project file (.gpr) also to 
save the state of your work. The project file stores the opened data set names
and opened windows state. There is a .msk file beside the project file to save 
the state of parameters.

It also contains the field-book and coordinate list definitions (masks).
Each mask has three lists to define data, field format and field size. 
These lists are collected in three associative arrays, the mask name is the
index. Separate arrays are
maintened for field-books and coordinate lists, *geoMasks*, *geoMaskParams* and
*geoMaskWidths* for field-books and *cooMaks*, *cooMaksParams* and *cooMaksWidths*
for coordinate lists.
